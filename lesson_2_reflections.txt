What happens when you create new repository and why should you?
You create a new repository when you want to add version control and git tracking
to the given directory (/project).
Until you do, git doesn't know to track the given folder. When you do, it sets up the neccessary
folder structure (/.git) and processes (?) to do so.

Why do you need a staging area?
The staging area contains the files that you want to track and make part of the 
NEXT commit. Not all files need to be added to the staging area, allowing each commit
to contain only logical changes.
The key thing to remember here is that the repository doesn't contain
these changes YET. The working directory contains all files.
